# Act-4 Build your own Website
This art portfolio website, created by Emm Katrina Caayao and Shaira Nicole Basulgan, is a collaborative project designed to highlight artistic talent and creativity. 

The website leverages HTML for content structuring, CSS for visually appealing designs, and JavaScript to incorporate interactivity and dynamic animations, enhancing user engagement. The concept originated from Caayao, who provided the initial visual sketches to guide the project. She also provided the art pieces that was presented in the website.

Basulgan took the lead in designing the website's layout and aesthetic, while both collaborators contributed to the programming and functionality development, ensuring a seamless and polished final product. The portfolio is hosted live using Netflify.
